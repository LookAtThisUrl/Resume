# My Personal Website
## http://ScottHSmith.com

I added my personal website to GitHub for three reasons: 

- To gain experience using git and GitHub
- As an additional backup in case all hell breaks loose
- Obviously, for version control

My goal is to adhere to the highest, futureproof web standards, but if you see something wrong feel free to contact me or issue a pull request. Enjoy!
